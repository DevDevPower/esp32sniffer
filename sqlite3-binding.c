/******************************************************************************
** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite
** version 3.39.4.  By combining all the individual C code files into this
** single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a single translation
** unit.  This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be
** possible if the files were compiled separately.  Performance improvements
** of 5% or more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single
** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other
** programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines
** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within
** the text of this file.  Search for "Begin file sqlite3.h" to find the start
** of the embedded sqlite3.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed
** if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of programming
** language. The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a
** separate file. This file contains only code for the core SQLite library.

/* Special Comments:
**
** Some comments have special meaning to the tools that measure test
** coverage:
**
**    NO_TEST                     - The branches on this line are not
**                                  measured by branch coverage.  This is
**                                  used on lines of code that actually
**                                  implement parts of coverage testing.
**
**    OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE        - This branch is allowed to alway be false
**                                  and the correct answer is still obtained,
**                                  though perhaps more slowly.
**
**    OPTIMIZATION-IF-FALSE       - This branch is allowed to alway be true
**                                  and the correct answer is still obtained,
**                                  though perhaps more slowly.
**
**    PREVENTS-HARMLESS-OVERREAD  - This branch prevents a buffer overread
**                                  that would be harmless and undetectable
**                                  if it did occur.
**
** In all cases, the special comment must be enclosed in the usual
** slash-asterisk...asterisk-slash comment marks, with no spaces between the
** asterisks and the comment text.
